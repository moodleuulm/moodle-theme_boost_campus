Feature: When the Moodle theme is set to Boost campus, the "Add a block" widget can be set
    either to be in the nav drawer or in the default block column.

  Scenario: Log in as admin and set the "Add a block" widget to be in the nav drawer
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Appearance > Themes > Boost Campus" in site administration
    And I click on "Advanced settings" "link"
    And I set the field "Position of \"Add a block\" widget" to "At the bottom of the nav drawer"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I turn editing mode on
    Then I should see "Add a block" in the "nav-drawer" "region"
